My TelegramBot has all the functionality you need to manage your personal expenses comfortably, including the ability to view statistics (including graphs)ðŸ™ƒ

To work with the project, you need to 
1. Install Redis (you can do this by typing "docker run --name my-redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis" in the terminal).
2. Replace the token with your own in the appsettings.json of the TelegramBot service.
